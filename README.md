Developed and evaluated multiple VGGFace descriptor models, extracting features from layers such as Flatten and Dropout, to determine their alignment with human facial similarity judgments by constructing and analyzing cosine similarity matrices.

Constructed detailed cosine similarity matrices for intermediate layers of the VGGFace model, and compared these matrices against human-rated similarity scores from Amazon Mechanical Turk, utilizing Spearman's rank correlation coefficient for statistical validation.

Implemented data preprocessing pipelines using Python libraries (PIL, OpenCV, NumPy) to augment and normalize large-scale facial image datasets, ensuring high-quality input for VGGFace model training and evaluation.

Applied advanced statistical tools from the SciPy library to analyze and visualize the similarity metrics, identifying specific VGGFace layers that most closely replicate human perception of facial similarity, enhancing the model's applicability in real-world scenarios.
